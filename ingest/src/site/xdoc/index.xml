      <section name="About Ingest">
         <p>The Ingest program set is part of the HORIZON system, which retrieves and receives data
            from remove/local location into managed file store. The Ingest service is designed as a
            reusable webserivce. The service is to be live close to the physical file store (e.g.
            staging or archive disk). In HORIZON there are collections of ingest instances to serve as
            ingestion to pre-archive location, ingestion to archive, and deletion of old data when
            replace is required.</p>
