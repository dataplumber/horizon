{Installation}

   This document describes how to install and configure the Dataset Rollout web application. The following sections can be found in this document:

{Necessary Software}

   The dataset manager tool in its current form can function as minimally as just have an Apache server (or PHP5 compatible web server) with PHP5 installed. Additionaly, the PO.DAAC "Manager" software must be running at an accesible location to the web server. Please see the installation guide for that software if required. No database is required for this release, just write permission to an XML output directory and access to a Manager grails application.

   The Dojo Toolkit is also required for this software to run, but a compatible version is supplied in the /js directory. No set up is required for this. 

{Build Instructions}

   The Dataset Rollout tool can be deployed as easily as copying the contents of src/main/html to an active web server directory. A standard apache installation defaults to /var/www, however this should be changed to a desired location. The directory structure must remain intact minus the "xml" directory. Configuration is required to get the application running correctly on the machine.
   
   * Software Configuration
   
   The dataset manager tool requires minimal configuration. Under src/main/html, the lone config file "config.php" should be inspected and modified. Server information as well as directory configurables are located in this file.

   $MANAGER_URL represents the base location of the desired PO.DAAC manager application
   $MANAGER_LOGIN represents the relative login API call from $MANAGER_URL. This should only be changed if the Manager software is ever updated with a change in its Dataset Manager API.
   $MANAGER_PROCESS represents the relative process API call from $MANAGER_URL. This should only be changed if the Manager software is ever updated with a change in its Dataset Manager API.
   $OUTPUT_DIR represents the absolute path where the XML files (for saves and work in progress loads) will be written.
