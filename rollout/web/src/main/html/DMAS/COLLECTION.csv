"55","JASON-1_SEA_SURFACE_HEIGHT_ANOMALY","Jason-1 Sea Surface Height Anomaly (SSHA)","PRODUCT","The Jason-1 Sea Surface Height Anomaly product is generated from the Jason-1 Geophysical Data Record (J1 GDR). There are 127 orbits per cycle and each orbit has a period of 112 minutes. The ground track of the orbits are about 315 km apart at the equator. Along track measurements are approximately 1 sec and 6 km apart. Each orbit is composed of 2 passes, one ascending from -66 deg to +66 deg latitude and the other descending from +66 deg to - 66 deg. The passes are organized this way to avoid data boundaries in the middle of the oceans. All odd-numbered passes are ascending and all even-numbered passes are descending. It is organized as 10 day repeat cycles containing a maximum of 254 pass files per cycle, the same as the J1 GDR. There is a one to one correspondence between the SSHA and J1 GDR cycles and pass files. Each pass file of the SSHA consists of header records followed by data records containing 11 parameters: 
time of record in days and milliseconds, latitude, longitude, sea surface height anomaly, significant wave height, inverse barometer, sigma0, total electron content of the atmosphere, ocean depth, and mean sea surface. It is swath data and no images are provided with this product. The Sea Surface Height Anomaly, the principal parameter in this product, represents the difference between the best estimate of the sea surface height and a mean sea surface. The sea surface height used was corrected for atmospheric effects (ionosphere, wet and dry troposphere), effects due to surface conditions (electromagnetic bias), and other contributions (ocean tides, pole tide, and inverse barometer). Because some users may want to provide their own values for the mean sea surface and inverse barometer effect, the values used in calculating this SSHA are included in the data product."

There are 127 orbits per cycle and each orbit has a period of 112 minutes. The ground track of the orbits are about 315 km apart at the equator. Along track measurements are approximately 1 sec and 6 km apart. Each orbit is composed of 2 passes, one ascending from -66 deg to +66 deg latitude and the other descending from +66 deg to - 66 deg. The passes are organized this way to avoid data boundaries in the middle of the oceans. All odd-numbered passes are ascending and all even-numbered passes are descending. There are a maximum of 254 passes per cycle. It is organized as 1 file per cycle and contains a header record followed by 254 records of SSHA parameters. Each file record represents a pass file of the cycle and the SSHA parameters correspond to measurement values taken from the Jason-1 Sea Surface Height Anomaly (J1SSHA) product. The times and SSHA values from the J1SSHA products are gridded along the satellite ground track. Each SSHA value in the ATG was derived using a set of cubic spline coefficients with reference latitudes and longitudes as the independent variable. Thus, these interpreted SSHA values are tied to a fixed set of reference latitudes and longitudes. Also, before interpretation, the ionospheric correction used in the SSHA was replaced by a smoothed value by averaging 8 iono values before and after the given iono. The 8 iono values correspond to approximately 50 km along track on either side of the given location of the iono data point. The Sea Surface Height Anomaly, the only parameter in this product, represents the difference between the best estimate of the sea surface height and a mean sea surface. The sea surface height used was corrected for atmospheric effects (ionosphere, wet and dry troposphere), effects due to surfa 
ce conditions (electromagnetic bias), and other contributions (ocean tides, pole tide, and inverse barometer)."

After acquisition and calibration at CMS, the NOAA/AVHRR data are re-mapped onto a stereopolar grid to produce mosaics of consecutive orbits over Europe and the Near Atlantic at a 2 km resolution. Mosaics are made over a ""Rectification Grand Domaine"" area (RGD). For re-mapped grid points observed by more than one overpass, the smallest satellite zenith angle data are selected. In the normal conditions when two satellites are operational, four mosaics per day are produced for all the AVHRR channels. SSTs are then calculated from these data. Six zones are then extracted . They are 1024 * 1024 pixels in size to offer the users (presumably interested by local phenomena) the possibility of handling a restricted volume of data. Note that SSTs are calculated over the entire RGD, but only the predefined zones are delivered as NAR products.The operational CMS AVHRR cloud mask in use is based on a multi-spectral thresholding algorithm (Derrien and Le Gleau 1999). Some refinements specific to the marine conditions have been introduced including Use of fine scale climatology and a fine gradiant climatology to assist in the detection of clouds in areas characterised by strong thermal gradients. SSTs are derived from the 11 and 12 micron brightness temperatures (T11 and T12) . The NOAA /AVHRR has three IR channels : channel 3 (3.6-3.8 micron), channel 4 (10.2-11.2 micron) and channel 5 (11.5-12.5 micron) which provide IR data at 1-km spatial resolution at the satellite subpoint (Kidwell, 1997). NOAA-14 and NOAA-16 have similar characteristics, but with distinct radiometer filter functions that necessitate distinct algorithm coefficients. The algorithms coefficients are derived from multilinear regression on a simulation database . At night the use of the 3.7 channel in a triple window algorithm improves the SST retrieval performances under high water vapor content conditions.  The expected accuracy is defined as the expected bias and standard deviation of the primary calculations against drifting buoy measurements determined on a monthly or yearly basis. The following performance evaluation was derived from a detailed validation of NOAA/AVHRR derived SSTs (Brisson et al 2001). Bias: Apart for the first 2 months after the launch of a new satellite, the monthly biases should remain within +/-0.4 K by night. By day local biases of several K are possible because of shallow diurnal heating. 
Standard deviation: see table below: low-cloud cases (cloud coverage less than 10% of the validation box) have been separated from all cases (cloud coverage less than 60%). The ""expected maximum standard deviation"" or the expected maximum biases are the maximum values that can be observed under normal conditions. When these values are overpassed, some anomaly may have occurred and the problem must be identified. Standard deviation Table Yearly, all Monthly, all Yearly, low-cloud Monthly, lowcloud 0.7 0.8 0.6 0.7 
Physical definition 
subskin SST : Comparable to in situ (buoy) measurements at night. 
Relation to bulk SST: equivalent to bulk SST by night. By day, a bias of several Kelvin may be found under favorable diurnal heating conditions, 
Relation to skin SST: By day and by night the subskin SST is convertible to skin temperature by subtracting 0.2K.

Long)","PRODUCT","Enhanced resolution images made from SeaWinds data use two different forms of the single-variate Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) algorithm: for egg sigma-0 measurements the SIR algorithm is used while for slice sigma-0 measurements, the SIR with filtering (SIRF) algorithm is used. For egg measurements the full antenna/processing spatial response is used while a simplified spatial response function in which the spatial response is assumed to be 1 over the footprint and 0 elsewhere is used for slice measurements. The SIR algorithm with eggs makes images of sigma-0 at the measurement incidence angle on an 4.5 km pixel grid. The effective resolution varies depending on region and sampling conditions but is estimated to be 8-10 km in most areas. The SIRF algorithm with slices makes A images at 2.225 km pixel spacing with an estimated effective resolution of 6-8 km. Slice measurements are much noisier than egg measurements.

It builds on the success of its predecessor instruments on the ERS-1 and ERS-2 satellites, and will lead to a 15+ year record of precise and accurate global Sea- Surface Temperature (SST) measurements, thereby making a valuable contribution to the long-term climate record. The exceptionally high radiometric accuracy and stability of AATSRdata are achieved through a number of unique features. A comprehensive pre-launch calibration programme, combined with continuous in-flight calibration, ensures that the data are continually corrected for sensor drift and degradation. A ""dual-view"" technique offering improved atmospheric correction is used to derive SSTskin observations. The accuracies achieved with this configuration are further enhanced by using low-noise infrared detectors, cooled to their optimum operating temperature by a pair of Stirling-cycle coolers. With its high-accuracy, high-quality imagery and channels in the visible, near-infrared and thermal wavelengths, AATSR data will support many applications in addition to oceanographic and climate research, including a wide range of land-surface, cryosphere and atmospheric studies.

The multichannel sea surface temperature algorithm (MCSST) has been used to routinely calculate SSTs using a split window approach. Currently this algorithm is applied by the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) to calculate SSTs at a near real-time rate.    The multichannel sea surface temperature algorithm uses a set of linear coefficients to retrive sea surface temperature from the brightness radiances. Improved cloud retrieval algorithms applied by NAVOCEANO have significantly increased the number of SST pixels flagged as cloud free, as compared to previous MCSST data sets. The NAVOCEANO MCSST data sets provide a high quality near real time sea surface temperature data set with a high number of cloud free retrievals. Additionally the orbital temporal and 9km spatial resolutions allow this data to be used in a quasi real time mode for detection of mesoscale features such as eddies associated with major current systems. The history of SST computation from AVHRR radiances is discussed at length by- -------------McClain et al., 1985--. Briefly, radiative transfer theory is used to correct for the effects of the atmosphere on the observations by utilizing ""windows"" of the electromagnetic spectrum where little or no atmospheric absorption occurs. Channel radiances are transformed (through the use of the Planck function) to units of temperature, then compared to a-priori temperatures measured at the surface. This comparison yields coefficients which, when applied to the global AVHRR data, give estimates of surface temperature which have been nominally accurate to 0.7 degrees Celsius. Each AVHRR scan views Earth for 51.282 milliseconds, during which time each channel of the analog data output is digitized. Scans occur at the rate of 6 per second, and the sampling rate of the AVHRR sensors is 39,936 samples per second per channel. During a scan, the detectors view an internal target, cold space, and the external scene. The temperature of the internal target is monitored, and space is assumed to have a black- body temperature of 3K. In this way, a simple two-point linear calibration is done internally (Schwalb, 1978). The nonlinear modification to this calibration is achieved at the time of postprocessing, and takes into account sensor nonlinearities, measurement of internal target temperature, calculation of target radiance, internal reflections and emissions, etc.  Sensor/Instrument Measurement Geometry:The AVHRR has a cross-track scanning system which use an elliptical beryllium mirror rotating at 360 RPM about an axis parallel to the Earth. The 110.8 degree cross-track scan equates to a swath width of about 2700 km. This swath width is greater than the 25.3 degree separation between successive orbital tracks, and provides overlapping coverage. Coverage is global, twice daily, at an instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of ~1.4 milliradians, giving a ground field of view of ~1.1 km at nadir for a nominal altitude of 833 km. Full resolution AVHRR data are continuously transmitted and recorded in High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) format.

After acquisition and calibration at CMS, the NOAA/AVHRR data are re-mapped onto a stereopolar grid to produce mosaics of consecutive orbits over Europe and the Near Atlantic at a 2 km resolution. Mosaics are made over a ""Rectification Grand Domaine"" area (RGD). For re-mapped grid points observed by more than one overpass, the smallest satellite zenith angle data are selected. In the normal conditions when two satellites are operational, four mosaics per day are produced for all the AVHRR channels. SSTs are then calculated from these data. Six zones are then extracted . They are 1024 * 1024 pixels in size to offer the users (presumably interested by local phenomena) the possibility of handling a restricted volume of data. Note that SSTs are calculated over the entire RGD, but only the predefined zones are delivered as NAR products.The operational CMS AVHRR cloud mask in use is based on a multi-spectral thresholding algorithm (Derrien and Le Gleau 1999). Some refinements specific to the marine conditions have been introduced including Use of fine scale climatology and a fine gradiant climatology to assist in the detection of clouds in areas characterised by strong thermal gradients. SSTs are derived from the 11 and 12 micron brightness temperatures (T11 and T12) . The NOAA /AVHRR has three IR channels : channel 3 (3.6-3.8 micron), channel 4 (10.2-11.2 micron) and channel 5 (11.5-12.5 micron) which provide IR data at 1-km spatial resolution at the satellite subpoint (Kidwell, 1997). NOAA-14 and NOAA-16 have similar characteristics, but with distinct radiometer filter functions that necessitate distinct algorithm coefficients. The algorithms coefficients are derived from multilinear regression on a simulation database . At night the use of the 3.7 channel in a triple window algorithm improves the SST retrieval performances under high water vapor content conditions.  The expected accuracy is defined as the expected bias and standard deviation of the primary calculations against drifting buoy measurements determined on a monthly or yearly basis. The following performance evaluation was derived from a detailed validation of NOAA/AVHRR derived SSTs (Brisson et al 2001). Bias: Apart for the first 2 months after the launch of a new satellite, the monthly biases should remain within +/-0.4 K by night. By day local biases of several K are possible because of shallow diurnal heating. 
Standard deviation: see table below: low-cloud cases (cloud coverage less than 10% of the validation box) have been separated from all cases (cloud coverage less than 60%). The ""expected maximum standard deviation"" or the expected maximum biases are the maximum values that can be observed under normal conditions. When these values are overpassed, some anomaly may have occurred and the problem must be identified. Standard deviation Table Yearly, all Monthly, all Yearly, low-cloud Monthly, lowcloud 0.7 0.8 0.6 0.7 
Physical definition 
subskin SST : Comparable to in situ (buoy) measurements at night. 
Relation to bulk SST: equivalent to bulk SST by night. By day, a bias of several Kelvin may be found under favorable diurnal heating conditions, 
Relation to skin SST: By day and by night the subskin SST is convertible to skin temperature by subtracting 0.2K. 
Units and range 
Units: Centi-Kelvins 
When using GRIB format, a scaling factor of 100 must be applied. 
No lower limit is imposed on the SST calculations, providing the sea is ice free. The expected range is thus from about -3 degC till 35 degC, corresponding to actual values of 27000 to 30800. 
Unprocessed data (for whatever reason) show a negative value (-32768) in HDF format, or is flagged as missing in GRIB section3.

The multichannel sea surface temperature algorithm (MCSST) has been used to routinely calculate SSTs using a split window approach. Currently this algorithm is applied by the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) to calculate SSTs at a near real-time rate.    The multichannel sea surface temperature algorithm uses a set of linear coefficients to retrive sea surface temperature from the brightness radiances. Improved cloud retrieval algorithms applied by NAVOCEANO have significantly increased the number of SST pixels flagged as cloud free, as compared to previous MCSST data sets. The NAVOCEANO MCSST data sets provide a high quality near real time sea surface temperature data set with a high number of cloud free retrievals. Additionally the orbital temporal and 9km spatial resolutions allow this data to be used in a quasi real time mode for detection of mesoscale features such as eddies associated with major current systems. The history of SST computation from AVHRR radiances is discussed at length by- -McClain et al., 1985--. Briefly, radiative transfer theory is used to correct for the effects of the atmosphere on the observations by utilizing ""windows"" of the electromagnetic spectrum where little or no atmospheric absorption occurs. Channel radiances are transformed (through the use of the Planck function) to units of temperature, then compared to a-priori temperatures measured at the surface. This comparison yields coefficients which, when applied to the global AVHRR data, give estimates of surface temperature which have been nominally accurate to 0.7 degrees Celsius. Each AVHRR scan views Earth for 51.282 milliseconds, during which time each channel of the analog data output is digitized. Scans occur at the rate of 6 per second, and the sampling rate of the AVHRR sensors is 39,936 samples per second per channel. During a scan, the detectors view an internal target, cold space, and the external scene. The temperature of the internal target is monitored, and space is assumed to have a black- body temperature of 3K. In this way, a simple two-point linear calibration is done internally (Schwalb, 1978). The nonlinear modification to this calibration is achieved at the time of postprocessing, and takes into account sensor nonlinearities, measurement of internal target temperature, calculation of target radiance, internal reflections and emissions, etc.  Sensor/Instrument Measurement Geometry:The AVHRR has a cross-track scanning system which use an elliptical beryllium mirror rotating at 360 RPM about an axis parallel to the Earth. The 110.8 degree cross-track scan equates to a swath width of about 2700 km. This swath width is greater than the 25.3 degree separation between successive orbital tracks, and provides overlapping coverage. Coverage is global, twice daily, at an instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of ~1.4 milliradians, giving a ground field of view of ~1.1 km at nadir for a nominal altitude of 833 km. Full resolution AVHRR data are continuously transmitted and recorded in High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) format. The Global Area Coverage (GAC) data are subsampled to approximately 4 km IFOV, recorded internally, and downlinked daily. The MCSST coefficients are then applied to the infrared brightness radiances to convert to SST.
