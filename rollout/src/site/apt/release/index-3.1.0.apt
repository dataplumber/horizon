{Capabilities}

  This section details the new, modified and corrected capabilities that comprise this release of the Rollout Program Set. In lieu of listing the capabilities by requirement they have been summarized. For a complete list of the requirements and their support status, see {{{Appendix_A_-_Requirements_Support}Appendix A}}.

* New Capabilities

  * {{{https://podaac-cm.jpl.nasa.gov/trac/ticket/937}Ticket 937}} - Persistent ID support added. Text field adheres to the strict pattern the persistent ID field expects. 

* Modified Capabilities

  * {{{https://podaac-cm.jpl.nasa.gov/trac/ticket/868}Ticket 868}} - Leading and trailing white space now automatically trimmed for all fields.
  
  * {{{https://podaac-cm.jpl.nasa.gov/trac/ticket/889}Ticket 889}} - Increased text field length to accommodate location policy fields.
  
  * {{{https://podaac-cm.jpl.nasa.gov/trac/ticket/911}Ticket 911}} - All number text boxes have been remade to be text boxes enforcing number rather than the number spinner widget.
  
* Corrected Capabilities

  * None

{Liens}

  This section details the liens against the capabilities that have yet to be implemented or are partially implemented. In lieu of listing the liens by requirement they have been summarized. For a complete list of the requirements and their support status, see {{{Appendix_A_-_Requirements_Support}Appendix A}}.

  * {{{https://podaac-cm.jpl.nasa.gov/trac/ticket/536}Ticket 536}} - Collection association with datasets not being removed properly.

{System Requirements}

  The software contained in this program set was developed in a Red Hat Linux environment on an Intel processor.With proper configuration this tool will run on any operating system running Ant, Java, and Tomcat. The software requires 2 megabytes of memory and depending on the data volume 70 megabytes of disk space. This disk space requirement does not include the disk space needed by the Jason data products.

  The software is dependent on the OCEANDIS and Legacy Ingest programs. These programs transfer the Jason data products from the delivery locations to their restricted locations. These interface locations are specified in the program properties files which are described in the {{{../j1-streamline/install/index.html}Installation}} document.

  * PO.DAAC Standard Computing Environment

  This will eventually be documented on the Wiki and linked to in future releases. For now, the following software and tools should be available in the current environment:

    * Apache Ant 1.7.X

    * Apache Tomcat Application Server 5.5.X

    * Subversion Client 1.3.X

    * Sun Java Standard Edition (J2SE) 1.6.X

[]

  * Oracle Database Server

  The Product Rollout Program Set requires an instance of the Oracle Database Server to be installed, configured for PO.DAAC and running in the current environment. This requirement should be satisfied by the PO.DAAC Oracle database administrator.

{Compilation}

  The details for building the software are contained in the {{{../j1-streamline/install/index.html}Installation}} document. But prior to building the software it must be checked out from the repository. This release has been tagged with version <3.1.0> and is available from the Product Rollout tags directory in the main software repository. The source code can be checked out from CM with the following command:

+--
svn checkout https://podaac-cm/repo/trunk/rollout/tags/3.1.0/j1-streamline/
+--

{Installation}

  The Dataset Manager Tool's install guide can be found {{{../web/install/index.html}here}}

  This section details the procedures for installing and configuring the software in this program set. This release is intended for deployment in the Integration & Test environment as well as the Operations environment. Installation is covered in a separate {{{../j1-streamline/install/index.html}Installation}} document.

* Integration and Test Environment

  The following diagram details where the major components of this release should be installed in the Integration & Test environment and gives a very high-level view of the interfaces between the components and system resources:

[../images/release_1.1.0_it_deployment.jpg]

  In the diagram above, orange boxes represent delivered PO.DAAC software components while yellow boxes represent third-party software components. 

* Operations Environment

  The following diagram details where the major components of this release should be installed in the Operations environment and gives a very high-level view of the interfaces between the components and system resources:

[../images/release_1.1.0_ops_deployment.jpg]

  The is essentially the same diagram as the Integration & Test environment but with different machine names. 

{Operation}

  The Dataset Manager Tool's operation guide can be found {{{../web/operation/index.html}here}}

  This section details any necessary setup and the commands for running the applications in this program set. Operation is covered in a separate {{{../j1-streamline/operate/index.html}Operation}} document.

{Appendix A - Requirements Support}

  The capabilities in this release are detailed in the table below based on the requirements specified in the {{{https://bravo-lib.jpl.nasa.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Version-512119/JasonStreamliningRequirementsV1.1.doc}Jason Streamlining Software Requirements Document (SRD)}}. The values for the Support column are defined as follows:

  * <<Full>> - The capability specified by the associated requirement has been implemented and tested at the program set level.

  * <<Partial>> - The capability has been partially implemented. The content of the Description column should provide more details.

  * <<No>> - The capability has not yet been implemented.
