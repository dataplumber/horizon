         <p>This document describes how to use the Security API applications. Each section
            corresponds with an available application. The following sections can be found in this
            document:</p>
         <ul>
            <li><a href="#SAPI">SAPI</a></li>
         </ul>
      </section>
      <section name="SAPI" id="SAPI">
         <p>This application is a command-line tool to allow users to genereate tokens with the
            security service for a specified realm. Tokens can be used in places of passwords for
            any tool using the security service.</p>
         <p>This application should be run as follows:</p>
         <source>% ./sapi</source>
         <p>And you'll be prompted with the following options:</p>
         <source>
&gt; Please enter the SecurtyService Host (i.e. https://lanina): https://lanina
&gt; Please enter the SecurtyService Port: 9192
&gt; Please enter the realm you want to create a token for: HORIZON-INVENTORY
&gt; Please enter your username: gangl
&gt; Please enter your password: 
         </source>
         <p>Note that the host and prot may not be required if they are configured in the
            sapi.properties file. The password field will not echo back responses. The program will
            exit without any output on success, but will create an entry in the ~/.maple file.</p>
         <p>~/.maple was used as the file name because it's unique, and sapi (security-api) sounds
            like sappy. Like syrup.</p>
