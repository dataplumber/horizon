      <section name="Overview">
         <p>Manager is a middleware web service implemented using the <a class="externalLink"
               href="http://grails.org">Grails</a> web framework. The purpose of this middleware is
            to be the management service for data ingestion and archival federation. Some of the
            capabilities of the Manager include</p>
         <ul>
            <li>User management</li>
            <li>Service management</li>
            <li>Storage management</li>
            <li>Load-Balanced job assignment</li>
            <li>Automatic retry</li>
            <li>Service monitoring</li>
         </ul>

      <section name="Service Architecture">
         <p>The illustration below is the higher level architectural diagram of a system using the
            Manager. Both the Ingest and Archive services can be deployed dynamically without
            rebooting the Manager.</p>

      <section name="State Machine">
         <p>The illustration below identifies the states for handling a product from initial
            ingestion request to archived. When a product has been successfully archived, Manager
            automatically triggers cleanup on the ingest's staging area.</p>

      <section name="Start and Stop Manager Web Service">
         <p>For the current distribution of Manager Web Service runs as a Grail application. There
            are ways to package the Manager as a WAR (Web Archive) for service container (Tomcat,
            Jetty, etc) deployment, but this deploymebnt model has not be tested by the DMAS
            development team.</p>
         <ul>
            <li><i>Start the service</i> By default, the service listens on TCP port 8080 (by
               default)
               <source>
% grails -Dgrails.env=development run-app
# look for message
# Server running. Browse to http://localhost:8080/manager
               </source>
            </li>
            <li><i>Stop the service</i> Opeartor could stop the serivce by issuing <i>Control-C</i>
               or use the system's <i>kill</i> command. </li>
         </ul>
